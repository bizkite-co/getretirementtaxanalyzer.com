## What is The Roadmap?

The Roadmap is a web-based application designed to generate a detailed 30+ year retirement spend-down table. It incorporates tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified assets, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), Social Security Income (SSI), and passive income streams to provide a clear and comprehensive financial forecast for your clients.
