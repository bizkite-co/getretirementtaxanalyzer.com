            <h2>30+ Year Spend-Down Table</h2>
            <p>The core of The Roadmap is its ability to generate a detailed, year-by-year spend-down table that projects a client's financial situation for over 30 years into the future. This table is an invaluable tool for visually representing a client's financial trajectory throughout their retirement years.</p>

            <h4>Tax-Qualified & Non-Tax-Qualified Assets</h4>
            <p>The Roadmap meticulously accounts for both tax-qualified assets, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, and non-tax-qualified assets, like taxable brokerage accounts. This recognizes the importance of their tax implications during the accumulation and distribution phases of retirement.</p>
